# Indian Sign Language Recognition

This repository contains code and resources for recognizing Indian Sign Language gestures using machine learning techniques.

## Repository Contents

- **data_collection.py**: Script for collecting and preprocessing gesture data.
- **train.py**: Script for training the machine learning model on the collected data.
- **prediction.py**: Script for making predictions using the trained model.
- **T3 Report.pdf**: Detailed report on the project, methodologies, and results.
- **T3 minor Sign Language-1.pptx**: Presentation summarizing the project's objectives and findings.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Data Collection**: Use `data_collection.py` to gather and preprocess gesture images or videos.
2. **Model Training**: Run `train.py` to train the model on the preprocessed data.
3. **Prediction**: Utilize `prediction.py` to recognize gestures using the trained model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Other libraries as specified in the scripts

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Execute `data_collection.py` to start collecting gesture data.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to capture and label gestures.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Run `train.py` to begin training the model.
   - Adjust hyperparameters as needed within the script.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Use `prediction.py` to make predictions on new gesture data.
   - Ensure the trained model is loaded correctly.

## Documentation

For detailed information on the project's design, implementation, and results, refer to `T3 Report.pdf`. The presentation `T3 minor Sign Language-1.pptx` provides a concise overview of the project's objectives and outcomes.
